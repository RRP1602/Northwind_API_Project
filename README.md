# About the Project
We have created a web api using the northwind database. Our project allows the user to mainpulate data within the products table within the database. The user can get products using the "ProductId", "CategoryId", "SupplierId" or the "Product Name". They can also add, delete and edit the products. tHey can view the producs using many different filters such as most popular products

# Built With
